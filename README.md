# LibertyBot 
LibertyBot is a community service project created by Theodore Gercken for libertarian discord servers. It provides free access to libertarian informational commands that can make any libertarian discord server stand out to anyone who wants to use it! This is currently the second version of the application. This website describes the application.

# Donate
Making LibertyBot available to everyone 24/7 costs money, so if you want to help out to make sure it keeps existing, feel free to donate to the patreon! [https://www.patreon.com/libertybot](https://www.patreon.com/libertybot)
